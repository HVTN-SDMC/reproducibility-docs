## Reproducibility README.md file example {.smaller}

```
# a) obtaining the code
wget https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting2/archive/refs/tags/xxxxxxxxx
unzip xxxxx
cd xxxxx

# b) restore R package dependencies
# assume the R package renv has been installed
R
    Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx") # use your personal github access token
    renv::restore()

# c) edit config.yml so that the data_cleaned field uder vat08_combined points to a local copy of vat08_combined_data_processed_20250417.csv

# d) generate report pdf
export TRIAL=cov2008_tcell
cd cor_coxph
make
